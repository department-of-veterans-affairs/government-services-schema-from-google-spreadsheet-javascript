Government Services Schema From Google Spreadsheet in Javascript
=========================================================

This is a simple JavaScript for pulling data from a Google Spreadsheet template and generating a JSON-LD schema for representing government services.

Here is the working spreadsheet - [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmRmiTou7vbjdGtqM193ajJuVTFidnNVMU9IRkdtZWc#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmRmiTou7vbjdGtqM193ajJuVTFidnNVMU9IRkdtZWc#gid=0)

Here is the working site, which all runs on Github, so you can fork and run in your own Github account with no server backend - [http://kinlane.github.io/government-services-schema-from-google-spreadsheet-in-javascript/](http://kinlane.github.io/government-services-schema-from-google-spreadsheet-in-javascript/)
